# Circus Project

The circus project is the largest and nearly-final project of the three years of computer science classes offered at my high school. The only required part of it is the write-up, which, since I did this in 2021 at the tail-end of the COVID quarantine, is in the form of a slideshow. My slideshow can be found online as a [google slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W2ZdkD0INduoYF3quKmHIq_MKYINg7BP07cEwzHWui4/edit?usp=sharing) or locally, in this git repository, as a [powerpoint presentation](write-up.pptx). 

I decided to implement it in both java and rust, the code for which can be found in the respectively named directories. 

The employees.txt file that they both read from is gitignored to protect the 187 people listed in it.

### Instructions

The instructions of the circus project are as follows:

>Welcome, Welcome, Welcome ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages!  The circus is in town and wow are there some doozies in it!  We have everything to thrill and amaze you from the bearded woman to the flying –olini’s.  Come one and all as they defy gravity in the heavens, tame ferocious lions, dive into glasses of water, sort multiple arrays, and even use pointers in an octopus style to simulate an alphabetic and numeric sorted list!  Yes, it is truly amazing.
>
>Your mission is to design a program that does the following:
>
>(1)	You are to read in from the file CircusEmployees.txt all the employees information.  It is broken up into the employee's name (first, last, and midInitial [# if none] ).  Also, you are to read in their social security number (idNum), their category, and their title.  For example:
>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; &#9608;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;012-345-678&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Entertainer&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ring _Master
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note: NO titles can be changed or a goose egg for a grade will be your result, especially the Ring Master!)
>
>(2)  With this list you are to do the following from the Menu( ):
> 
>(1)        Print list alphabetically\
>(2)        Print list by IdNum\
>(3)        Insert new Employee\
>(4)	Delete an Employee\
>(5)	Print only a particular category list of employees alphabetically\
>(6)	Print entire list of all employees by category alphabetically\
>(7)	Add a category\
>(8)	Delete a category (and ALL corresponding employees)\
>(9)	Quit
>
>What is your selection:
>
>Your Task:\
>ON PAPER  (1 page for each selection) CLEARLY design what this structure would look like.  How would you design the nodes? How would you design the layout, meaning all the references/pointers whether that be arrays, linked lists, Stacks/Queues, Trees, etc?  How would they correspond to one another?  How would you insert and delete nodes? Which is the best structure and why? Also, what are some of the alternatives? What is the Big-O of your design and ALL Menu options?
